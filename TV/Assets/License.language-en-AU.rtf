\
C. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the Apple Software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third party providing such content. This Licence does not grant you any rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.\
\

\f0\b 2. Permitted Licence Uses and Restrictions.

No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorised way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Apple is not in any way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive, infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the Services. \
\
F. In addition, Services and Third-Party Materials that may be accessed, linked to or displayed through the Apple Software are not available in all languages or in all countries or regions.
